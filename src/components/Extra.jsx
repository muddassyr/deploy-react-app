                <p>Now that we’ve discussed ten different ways to deploy React, you should try out as many as
                    you can
                    to determine which best aligns with your deployment requirements. After all, they’re free
                    to use.
                </p>
                <p>For a good next step, try to add custom domains to your deployed application. It’s good to
                    have a
                    distinctive domain for projects, which have different ways to add a custom domain — some easy,
                    some
                    relatively complex.</p>
